# Semantic Governance Kit v1 — Technical / Tool Pattern
## Marshall Triangle

**Status:** Frozen / Canonical Reference

**Project:** Marshall Triangle (Interactive Visualization & Tooling)

**Canonical Public Name:** Marshall Triangle

**Underlying System / Catalog Concept:** Harmony Index

**Primary Domains:**
- **Static Container / Documentation:** https://marshalltriangle.com
- **Interactive Application:** https://marshalltriangle.app

**Effective Date:** 2026-01-04

---

## Purpose

This document designates the **Marshall Triangle** project as the **canonical reference deployment** for **Semantic Governance Kit v1 — Technical / Tool Pattern**.

This pattern applies to domains that:
- Provide operational, user-interactive technical tools
- Implement conceptual frameworks through executable systems
- Generate artifacts (figures, exports, data) that may circulate independently
- Require clear separation between code, outputs, and underlying intellectual constructs

The objective of this pattern is to enable **open technical use** while preserving **conceptual authorship, attribution clarity, and downstream interpretive safety**.

---

## Scope & System Boundaries

### In Scope
- Interactive visualization application (Streamlit / future web deployments)
- Color-space computation and triadic equilibrium modeling
- Exportable visual outputs (PNG, figures, calibrated images)
- Open-source tooling and reproducibility infrastructure

### Out of Scope
- Claims of psychological, behavioral, or normative authority
- Claims of prescriptive governance or policy outcomes
- Assertions of exclusivity over mathematical primitives or color theory

---

## Canonical Architecture

### 1. Static Container Site

**Domain:** marshalltriangle.com

Role:
- Canonical human-readable reference
- Documentation and theoretical overview
- Licensing clarity
- Links to GitHub repository
- Links to Story Protocol declaration asset
- Explicit launch point for the live application

This site serves as the **semantic anchor** for evaluators, researchers, and automated systems.

---

### 2. Interactive Application

**Domain:** marshalltriangle.app

Role:
- Execute the Marshall Triangle model
- Allow real-time calibration and exploration
- Generate and export visual artifacts
- Operate as a technical tool, not a narrative surface

The application must include:
- Visible copyright notice
- Clear license references
- Link back to the static container site

---

## Licensing Model (Tri-Layer)

The Marshall Triangle adopts a **formal tri-layer licensing structure** to clearly separate technical openness from conceptual stewardship:

| Layer | Applies To | License |
|---|---|---|
| **Code** | app.py, harmony_index.py, tooling, infrastructure | MIT |
| **Figures & Visual Outputs** | Generated images, exports, derived visual artifacts | CC BY-NC 4.0 |
| **Conceptual Framework / Declaration** | Marshall Triangle concept, declaration, epistemic framing | All Rights Reserved (via Story Protocol) |

This structure:
- Enables open technical adoption and contribution
- Prevents unlicensed commercial reuse of outputs
- Preserves lawful authorship and symbolic integrity of the framework itself

---

## Intellectual Property Alignment

The Marshall Triangle concept and its sovereign declaration are anchored via **Story Protocol** as a distinct IP asset:

- **Asset:** marshall_triangle-v1-sovereign
- **Role:** Epistemic declaration and perceptual geometry anchor
- **Function:** Establishes authorship, provenance, and lawful symbolic geometry

The open-source repository does not supersede this declaration; it implements it.

---

## Compliance Characteristics

- Clear separation between tool, output, and concept
- No deceptive cloaking or content gating
- Explicit license signaling at all surfaces
- Compatibility with academic citation norms
- Compatibility with open-source tooling ecosystems
- Alignment with AI preparedness and provenance best practices

---

## Designation

As of the effective date, **Marshall Triangle** is designated as the **canonical reference deployment** for:

> **Semantic Governance Kit v1 — Technical / Tool Pattern**

All future technical tools implementing conceptual frameworks with executable outputs should derive from this pattern unless explicitly superseded.

---

## Change Control

Any modification to this deployment requires:
- Explicit documentation of rationale
- License impact review
- Version increment of Semantic Governance Kit
- Formal designation of successor reference deployment

Absent such action, this specification remains authoritative.
