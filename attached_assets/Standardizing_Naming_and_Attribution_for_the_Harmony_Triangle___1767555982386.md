# Standardizing Naming and Attribution for the Harmony Triangle / Marshall Color Space

**INTERNAL MEMO** *Date: March 29, 2025*  
 *From: Ethan / Project Lead*  
 *Subject: Standardizing Naming and Attribution for the Harmony Triangle / Marshall Color Space*

**To all collaborators, developers, designers, researchers, and documentation team members:**

This memo serves to clarify the naming conventions, authorship, and usage contexts for the system originally referred to as the *Harmony Triangle*.

---

### **1\. Terminology and Context-Specific Naming**

The core visualization system developed as part of this project represents a novel framework for understanding and navigating balanced forces (e.g., privacy, performance, personalization) through additive color theory. It is used in two contexts:

#### **A. In the General Scientific, Artistic, and Theoretical Context**

* **Primary Name**: *Marshall Triangle*

* **Alternative Terms**: *Marshall Color Space*, *Marshall Model*, *Marshall Field*

* **Usage**: In scientific literature, conceptual theory, research citations, and any work extending beyond the Galateia application.

* **Inventor**: Paul Warrington Marshall

* **Date of Creation**: March 27, 2025

* **Original Implementation**: Python-based rendering application (HarmonyIndex class)

This naming follows the precedent of established constructs like the Maxwell Triangle and allows the system to take its place as a standalone invention.

#### **B. In the Galateia Application Context**

* **In-App Term**: *Harmony Triangle*

* **Usage**: UI component and visualization system within the Galateia application; presented to users as part of a perceptual feedback mechanism or emotional navigation tool.

* **Purpose**: To provide users with a sense of equilibrium through perceptually blended RGB input, dynamically calibrated to the user-defined "white point".

In this context, we deliberately avoid using the term "Marshall Triangle" in the user-facing language to preserve Galateia's unique identity and UX simplicity.

### **2\. Why This Matters**

The system offers both:

* A **theoretical framework** that overcomes legacy limitations in RGB color space models like Maxwell's and CIE 1931 by allowing dynamic perceptual calibration.

* A **practical user experience tool**, especially within the Galateia App, for representing subjective equilibrium between competing design or behavioral forces.

### **3\. Unified Naming and Documentation Structure**

| Context | Standard Name | Alias(es) | Use Cases |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| General Research | Marshall Triangle | Marshall Color Space, etc. | Academic papers, open theory |
| Galateia Application | Harmony Triangle | (none) | UI component, Compute Settings module |

---

### **4\. Next Steps**

We are now organizing documentation under two distinct but related pillars:

* **I. Marshall Triangle / Color Space**

  * Theory, psychometric models, perceptual geometry

  * Open-source visualization algorithms

  * Scientific exploration and nomenclature

* **II. Galateia App**

  * Product architecture and UX flow

  * Harmony Triangle UI implementation

  * Compute Settings and user personalization logic

Team members should:

* Use the appropriate name depending on context.

* Ensure consistent documentation, UI labeling, and source references.

* Contribute updates to the evolving glossary and research folders.

Please contact Ethan with any questions or suggestions for refinement.
