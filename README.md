# Marshall Triangle Visualization Application

Proof-of-concept application demonstrating the Marshall Triangle rendering engine using Python and Streamlit.

## Overview

The Marshall Triangle is a visualization component for an adaptive AI interface that balances three key traits:
- **Privacy** (Red)
- **Performance** (Green)
- **Personalization** (Blue)

## Features

- Equilateral triangle with color blending at vertices
- Dynamic state vector controls for weighting each trait
- Triadic Calibration for custom white point calibration
- Save/load functionality for states and rendering presets
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit

## Technical Implementation

- Core visualization logic in `harmony_index.py`
- UI implemented in `app.py` using Streamlit
- State persistence using SQLite and JSON storage

## Status

Internal Prototype / Research
